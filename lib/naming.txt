NEW NAMES FOR CODE FILEs
(for tidyness)


Forget ".inc" - it's not meaningful. Just use .php

We'll still keep everything in "lib" to keep life simple.

Code files have their meaningful element FIRST in the filename

Then one of the following suffixes:

-act    -- a script that DOES something, but DOES NOT produce a UI  (must have exe stub) (currently uses -admin or -do but that's confusing)
-ui     -- a script that renders a UI (must have exe stub, which will not itself have any suffix)
-forms  -- functions that render a right-hand block for some tool UI (included by a -ui)
           (maybe also some support functions, but I'm trying to migrate those to html-lib)
-lib    -- underlying functions and classes. Both rendering HTML funcs, and doing something.

Non-CQPweb based units can be exceptions, e.g. rface.php, MAYBE cqp.php

AND we are going to standardise meaningful elements.

IE, not both "collocation" and "colloc"; not both "conc" and "concordance".
concordance

Get rd of redirect. USE sMART formz (JS ) for forms that need more than one destination.
